<!-- To use the star ratings all you have to do is:
        1. Include this file on pages that will need it.
        2. Put a rating input wherever you want on the page like this
 <input id="myRating" type="text" class="rating" data-size="lg" > 

        3. Make sure the rating has a unique ID
        4. Use the ID to get the input's value in javascript.
    Thats it-->
